# Telegram E-Commerce NER Project

This project aims to establish a centralized platform for Telegram-based e-commerce activities in Ethiopia. With the growing popularity of Telegram for business transactions, various independent e-commerce channels have emerged, each operating separately. This decentralization creates challenges for both vendors and customers, who must navigate multiple channels for product discovery, order placement, and communication.

To address these challenges, the project focuses on developing a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system specifically designed for the Amharic language. The NER system will extract key business entities, such as product names, prices, and locations, from text, images, and documents shared across multiple Telegram channels. The extracted data will be used to populate a centralized database, transforming the user experience by providing a unified platform for exploring and interacting with various vendors.


## Project Goals
- Create a unified platform for exploring multiple e-commerce Telegram channels.
- Implement a robust NER system to extract essential business entities from messages.
- Enhance the customer experience by consolidating real-time data into a single channel.
